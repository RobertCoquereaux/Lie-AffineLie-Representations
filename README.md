Decomposition of the product of irreducible representations of SU(n) into a sum of irreducible representations.
Drawing pictographs: honeycombs for admissible triples; if a branching rule a b -> c has multiplicity m, draw m distinct honeycombs.
Drawing pictographs: O-blades for admissible triples; if a branching rule a b -> c has multiplicity m, draw m distinct O-blades.
