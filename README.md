# Lie-AffineLie-Representations
Representations of Lie algebras, affine Lie algebra, quantum groups. Fusion algebras.
The repository contains mostly Mathematica code (nb or cdf format).
Available programs:
Decomposition of the product of irreducible representations of SU(n) into a sum of irreducible representations.
Drawing pictographs: honeycombs for admissible triples; if a branching rule a b -> c has multiplicity m, draw m distinct honeycombs.
Drawing pictographs: O-blades for admissible triples; if a branching rule a b -> c has multiplicity m, draw m distinct O-blades.
SymPol$Package: a package for symmetric polynomials in Mathematica (general, elementary symmetric, monomial symmetric, complete symmetric polynomials,power sums, Schur polynomials, Zonal polynomials, Jack polynomials), structure constants in various basis, inner products, etc. See a description (usage) and examples in the companion file SymPol$Examples.nb
