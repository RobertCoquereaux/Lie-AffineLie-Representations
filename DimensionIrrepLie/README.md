The program defines a function DimensionIrrepLie that gives the dimension (or the quantum dimension) of irreducible representations of simple complex Lie algebras.
There are two versions.
One version is a Mathematica package that can be loaded with a Get["â€¦/src/DimIrrepsLie.wl"].
This package contains a public part (with usage::) and a private part.
The second version is a Mathematica Resource Function (RF). It is a file derived from the above src/DimIrrepsLie.wl which was edited in order to comply with the publication rules of Wolfram RF. In particular it is not a package (although it contains a private part). The package DimIrrepsLie.wl should be considered as the prime reference.
At some point in the future, the contents of DimIrrepsLie.wl will be incorporated in a larger project Roots&Weights.
